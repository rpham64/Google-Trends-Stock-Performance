# Google-Trends-Stock-Performance

<h4> Date Created: December 9, 2013 </h4>

<h1> Synopsis </h1>

This is a class project that uses Google Trends data to analyze longitudinal trends in stock performances in the U.S. stock market. 
Four of my classmates and I created this as a final project for our Stat 133 class at UC Berkeley.
